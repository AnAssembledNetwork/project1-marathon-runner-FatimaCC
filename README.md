#Marathon Runner

Marathon Runner was the first project of the program that was assigned, to which we had 1 week to complete it in its totality.
The project consist of create a program that helps the user to check if the qualify to run in a Tokyo Marathon. What I had to do 
first in order to check if the user qualifies to run in the marathon is that I had to collect some information from the user such as 
their name, how many miles can they run in 10 minutes, how much US money they have saved for the marathon and then convert the
miles that they can run in 10 minutes to kilometers, and also convert their savings to YENS. After the conversion of  miles to kilometers
and US savings to YENS I had determine if they quilify for the marathon.The last thing that I had to do was to print a helpful
statement that tells them if they meet the requirements to participate or if they don't meet the requirements to participate.

The requirements were the following:
They must be able to pay 21,888 YENS
They should have a pace of at least .2km/minute.
